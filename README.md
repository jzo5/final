Online, profile pictures are something that can be used to differentiate who you are amongst thousands of other people. A lot of people put a lot of thought into what their profile picture can and should be, however, sometimes this effort can be overshadowed by the way that the pictures are so small. For this project, I coded a way to see pull up larger images of people's profile pictures on Github. I used BeautifulSoup for this project to scrape the information off the webpage that I decided to use. The result should be a link to the picture.![carbon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129027096/235571253-d20c1b83-fd89-4131-a022-c320680cbce6.png)

The code linked is a display of how BeautifulSoup works. It parses the information that the coder is asking for, and ultimately spits out something specific such as an image or some form of information.

If I had to do a follow-up on this project, I would likely try to find a link to the origin of the picture or the source. Like if it was a picture on pinterest or can be found in google images.
